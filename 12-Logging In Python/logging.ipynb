    "* **DEBUG** - Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.\n",
    "* **INFO** - Confirmation that things are working as expected.\n",
    "* **WARNING** - As indication that something unexpected happened or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g., 'Disk space low'). The software is still working as expected.\n",
    "* **ERROR** - Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.\n",
    "* **CRITICAL** - A very serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running."
