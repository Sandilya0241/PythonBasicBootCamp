    "#### Basic definition of Program:\n",
    "\n",
    "A program is a sequence of instructions written in programming language. [Ex: Python, C++]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ex: Google Chrome is an .exe file. This is a sequence of instructions -> Browser should work.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic definition of Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "A Process is simply an instance of a Program that is being executed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ex: Each and every chrome window is a process of Chrome Program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Resources shared with in the process are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Code Segment - This code that is required to run this particular process.\n",
    "* Data Segment - This is having list of all global and static variables.\n",
    "* Heap Memory - This is for dynamic memory allocation.\n",
    "* Stack - It is going to make sure that it has access to all the local variables, function calls.\n",
    "* Register - These are small memories to keep/ to store some of the variables or some logic for a smaller period of time.   \n",

    "* This will have separate memory space. So, one process cannot corrupt another process. This requires other I/O requirements. \n",
    "* Because of this, there will be increased execution time to switch between processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "1) Browser -> Process -> Id \n",
    "2) Excel -> Process -> Id\n",
